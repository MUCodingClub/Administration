# <p align="center">Murdoch Coding Club Code of Conduct</p>

### Introduction
The Murdoch Coding Club is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and safe experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We expect all members, including attendees, speakers, volunteers, and organizers of MCC events, to help us ensure a safe and positive community experience for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

### Be Respectful

- Treat all individuals with respect. 
- Discrimination or harassment in any form will not be tolerated.

### Collaboration Over Conflict

- Work collaboratively with others. Constructive critique is welcome, but criticism must be respectful and considerate. In return, be respectful to others sharing their critique. 
- Diverse perspectives are what foster a vibrant and rich environment in universities, and the club alike.

### We Never All Share the Same View

- In disagreements, strive to understand differing viewpoints. If consensus cannot be reached, agree to disagree and move forward respectfully.

### Positive Communication

- Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, or violent language. This includes all forms of communication, whether in-person or online. 
- In digital interactions, be especially mindful of your tone and the content you share. Written texts can often be misinterpreted due to the lack of non-verbal cues. Therefore, strive to be clear, respectful, and positive at all times.

### Consent and Boundaries

- Respect personal boundaries and seek explicit consent before engaging in physical contact or entering personal spaces. Be mindful of individuals' comfort levels and respect their wishes without question.

### Privacy and Confidentiality

- Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. This includes being careful with information that may be considered sensitive or personal. Examples of such information include, but are not limited to, contact details, personal stories or experiences, health-related information, and any content shared within a confidential setting or conversation.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct by any member of the MUCC community. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Reporting Guidelines

- If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a club official as soon as possible. You can report these behaviours to any club official via Discord by searching for @committee and messaging any of the members. You may also email your concern through to the club at `murdochcodingclub@gmail.com`.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

- Unacceptable behavior from any club member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Club officials may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the club.

### Addressing Grievances

- If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the club with a concise description of your grievance.

### Scope

- We expect all club participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct.
