# Administration
This repository is to store official club documents and keep a history of old versions. \
This also ensures that members outside of the committee are aware of any changes that have been made to the club documents by the committee and sub-committee.

Documents here have to go through a approval process before being commited to the repository, AND SHOULD NOT BE UPLOADED DIRECTLY TO THE REPOSITORY. \
Instead, proposed changes have to be submitted as a pull request and reviewed by members of the committee before being approved.
